        + allows balenaMachine(s)/BoB(s) to automatically configure itself

        * refactor confd.service to include both root-ca and host-envvars handling

        * add systemd path watcher to restart confd if keys/certs change during runtime

        * store stack configuration available to all services in a persistent/shared volume (/balena)

        * change resolver order to dns => mdns (ipv4) => mdns (ipv6) => return

        * configure API key and JOSE/JWT key id

        * configure open-balena-vpn (PKI) environment variables

        * configure Sentry DSNs

        * configure API keys/tokens

        * configure proxy and devices SSH keys

        * bundle Git SSH keys

        * refactor environment handling in non-systemd variant

      hash: bc5903d77867c3c969f1e7193cbef69dab12eeef
      body: |
        Debian Buster now uses Avahi 0.7 instead of
        0.6.32. This means that there is now a stricter
        policy defining MDNS domains. This commit allows
        us to use multipart subdomains.

        Historically, aliasing of containers occured via the use
        of the `--link` (or `links` property of `docker-compose`).
        This would be required on each container to ensure that
        the relevant alias would be added to the `/etc/hosts` file.
        However, this functionality is now deprecated in favour
        of the use of the `networks.<name>.aliases` property, set
        on a particular service to ensure all other services can
        reach that service using the bridge on which they exist.
        Unfortunately, this is carried out by adding the records
        to the Docker daemon's internal DNS, referenced before
        propagating to the host. Whilst this is good in theory,
        in the case where MDNS is used (and in particular the
        recommended Avahi `libnss-mdns` NS switch config) this
        means that MDNS is consulted *before* the Docker DNS
        service, in effect meaning that aliases to the internal
        IP address for a service are never used, and in effect
        negating them.
        To counter this, this commit ensures that DNS is
        *always* prioritised over MDNS. This has the effect of
        querying DNS for `.local` addresses, which can lead
        to an initial lag in lookups (although these should then
        be cached locally per service), and potentially more DNS
        traffic that ideal. However, for the purposes of a
        Devenv/OnPrem, this is acceptable.
        It has no effect on Cloud deployed instances, as they
        will not use `.local` suffixes.
